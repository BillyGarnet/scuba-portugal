This site is designed to teach you about Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) often called Behavioural Driven Development (BDD).
Using these testing techniques can help your team gain a better shared understanding of what you are building.
Other software used includes Behave and Selenium.
I hope you enjoy it.
Leave us a note if you have an idea to make it better.
We love improving!
